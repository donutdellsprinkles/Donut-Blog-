        <h1>Donut Planet</h1>
<h3>For the past year  or two I have always wanted to create THE retro social website, something that could give you a feeling
    of nostalgia to older times of online games. I always loved the whole community aspect of it, it actually felt like you were 
    interacting with a human on the other side of the screen. Though creating such thing came with its own big issues. <br>

    <img src="habbo.png"><br>
    I had a vision for creating some cool bases like these in habbo hotel
    <br><br>

    Probably the biggest issue I had is cooking up a server or some sort of database to store user data. I tried and I honestly failed
    honestly I feel like its something I will probably just earn later on in my journey but right now as 1 person cooking all this up I could not
    do much. The closest thing I did in terms of live interaction is a chat system which I created way back in Donut-Planet. 
    <br><br>
    You most probably haven't heard of Donut-Planet but it was my very first shot of cooking up a social website and to be real with you,
    it was a COMPLETE utter failure. It just lacked a lot of stuff to keep the user engaged and I felt like I was in this wormhole of constantly adding 
    features to it that seemed to be sort of pointless and they would just take up energy and time without adding any depth to the website.
    <br>
    Although I describe it as a failure, I think it was the project that launched me forward in just creating stuff. I consider a great learning experience 
    and it at least taught me what to do.
    <br>
    You see the main feature of Donut-Planet I personally think was its chatting system, although it had a bunch of other features 
    all the people who tried it out just mainly focused on the chatting which might not seem like a bad thing but you gotta know hosting stuff 
    that uses plugins such as websocket.io is not easy and I found that out the hard way. I mainly used the website Replit for hosting pretty much everything in 
    Donut-Planet and by the end of 2023 I found out Replit was putting all their web-hosting behind a paywall and that was the nail in the coffin for me 
    with Donut-Planet. I decided to call it quits and just move onto a different project 
<br><br>
</h3>
<h1>A New Hope</h1>
<h3>
    For pretty much the majority of 2024 I didn't really do much other than just create some ideas for projects I never worked on
    or fully committed to, this blog being one of them. I don't remember when exactly but it was half way into 2024 when I got the idea for 
    the biggest project I have ever created. 
    <br><br>
    "Take the charming isometric view of habbo hotel and the interactivity and and customization of Club Penguin and give them your iconic Donut touch" <br>
    It was like 3 am when the idea came to me and I just felt my heart absolutely leap, it might not seem like that good of an idea to you the reader but to me at the 
    time this was what lit the flame to the empty hole in me at the time. I managed to envision completely how <u>Donutroplis</u> would play out
    <br><br>
    At the beginning I basically thought to have 75% of the screen to be Donutropis and then the 25% on the right just be a chatting area where you can join different hubs and chat there.
    That idea eventually didn't work because Imma be honest with you making something like with the clunkiness of three.js scenes would just not be worth the effort as I am pretty certain 
    it would look terrible on every single screen size. <br><br>
    My main idea for interaction was kind of simple. You earn the curreny of sprinkles by working, playing some mini-games or trading/selling items you get.
    Now the main objective in Donut-troplis is to grow out your apartment and add to it different items you can buy or obtain by chance from different jobs.
    You can navigate around Donutroplis by visiting different donuts in th map where you can visit the apartments of different players and check out their items.
    <br><br>

    <img src="DTbase.png"><br>
    What my apartment looks like in Donut-Troplis (Ignore the massive floating cheese cube) <br><br>

    I believe its a decent gameplay loop to get people playing, adding value to a bunch of pixels is something every game out there does but the difference here is
    you can get all of this by just simply playing casually without having to spend your lifesavings or anything. Donutroplis is completely free from head to toe(ðŸ‘…)
    Now you might ask how is trading done if you don't know how to implement any sort of live service, well uhhh I managed to think of a work around but you might just laugh from
    the idea but hear me outtt. <br><br>
    So when I first started working on Donutroplis my main idea for it was to be mostly powered by discord in terms of interacting and trading which 
    I know some people might completely dislike, but honestly for the time being I don't really have a better alternative. You simply post a trading offer 
    in the discord channel of the Donutroplis discord server and then have someone hit you up. Once you both decide on what you receiving within the 
    trade, I then get hit up and I manually, yes you heard it yeppp, I manually just go and edit the code... wait hold on I didn't mention how the trading worked,
    so basically there is this area in donutroplis called the code-input area which is actually an idea taken from Donutplanet and slightly improved upon, so you input a code 
    and then you get sprinkles or items and stuff so I figured I could just edit the code every time there is a new request to create a unqiue code for both users to input 
    to get the trade where they lose an item and then gain a new item. so Yep I manually edit the code every time there is a new request now I know this sounds utterly stupid and to
    be real with you it is but for the time being thats all I could come up with and I never really planned for Donutroplis to exceed like 50 concurrent members so 
    you can kind of get why I chose that system. You can trade though.
<br><br>
    <i>Pst... If you are reading this input this code for a chance to win 2M sprinkles: x0ow2sd9a7 </i>
    <br><br>
    Now sprinkles are the main and only curreny in Donutroplis its basically your bread and butter. So you can earn them from mini games and work but mostly just from work,
    work in Donutroplis actually is varied into 2 types. An Instant job and then a mini-game job, depending on your performance 
    within the mini-game you could get paid more sprinkles from the job. So then with your obtained sprinkles you can buy new furniture and stuff to add to
    your apartment, this increases your base level which then unlocks new jobs for you. Get how the job and furniture system go together, I think its cool. 
    Now most of these jobs actually have a percent chance to either give you a furniture item or an inventory item. So for both types of items you can sell them 
    for sprinkles and trade them with other players, now honestly I love that. I absolutely love it. Collecting those rare items in a game and then showing 
    them off to other players just feels good you know. <br><br>

    <img style="width: 25%;" src="bagel.png"><br> You can earn a literal bagel from one of the jobs. <br><br>

    Finally, I decided to add something to sort of act as a final objective to Donutroplis and thats the exclusive membership 
    which costs 69,420 sprinkles. You are gonna call me childish I know, I couldn't help it though. Also if you ever manage to reach it 
    you might notice that it is... slightlyyyyyy uhh unfinished. Yeah its just like a cardboard layout that got nothing behind it. I don't really think 
    anyone is actually gonna reach it so I decided to leave it for later and honeslty by that period of time I was completely 
    exhausted from working on Donutroplis. 
    <br><br>
    When I say I wrote a 5 star gournment italian pasta meal in that code I really mean it, If it ever feels slow to you
    you can completely blame THEE THREE.JS NOT MEEE THE 600 LINES OF CODE IN A SINGLE PAGE HAS  NOTHING TO DO WITH IT BEING SLOW. 
    Its just three.js being clunky and all you feel me. For the time being I don't really got that dawg in me to go jumanji diving into the code 
    to try to fix it, cause once again I don't really think Donutroplis is gonna really exceed like 20 members?
    </h3>
<h1>Why?</h1>
    <h3>
        Now you might think that I have you know, shared this project with every living soul that I know. Cause after all its my
        biggest project ever and I really worked hard on it you get me. But uhh I didn't. I only shared to 1 single person who just ended up 
        playing some random mini-game I made for Donut-planet that I reintroduced to Donutroplis. Its been like a month or almost two
        since I finished the project and I feel like I sort of abandoned it not gonna lie. Writing this blog about it is kind of inspiring me 
        to give it a chance. Currently the discord server has no people in it other than me. You know what I gotta just try to get this project out somewhere 
        its worth a shot right!?!?!?
