            <h3>Hey, aoughgghh <br>
                I have been sitting here for the past 20 minutes thinking of something to say and to be frank with you
                there is not much to say as of right now other than maybe a couple of words of me welcoming you to this blog 
                but I am too cool for that, how about I introduce me. 
                </h3>
                <img src="sodabob.gif"><br>
                <h3>look at this soda can I cooked up</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>I have a passion for working on things, a lot of things. I sort of enjoy creating stuff, there is not really
                    one thing that I am particularly drawn to which is something that has been annoying me lately.<br> I just want to do
                    everything all at once which is realistically <u>unrealistic</u>, but thats what I like. I have taken passion in drawing though
                    I never got too good at it, videography (no idea what that even means but videos in general) I used to love
                    and I still do love documenting things and making videos on them though Its been a while since I have done
                    that I do think its the thing I am most experienced at. <br> I have been dipping my toes a little bit in 3D 
                    modelling but dipping toes I mean the surface of my toes just touching the waters of 3D, that soda can thing
                    I just showed you is probably my best 3D work right now but I honestly really do enjoy that stuff and I have
                    been practicing at it for a bit.<br><br> Also did try out writing which is something I also quite enjoy, I actually
                    have a lot of ideas that I personally (personally) think are quite entertaining though the most I ever
                    committed to was like 20 pages to what I considered to be a novel size story at the time, its still ongoing
                    but I haven't been adding much, writing also sort of came to me as a passion like a domino effect from
                    videos in general, writing scripts and all that made me really get into writing as well.<br> Music is something
                    I have experimented with, creating some mashups every now and then and actually experimenting on works and
                    sampling but thats stuff I dont think will ever see the day of light and as of right now I think my biggest
                    passion is programming, I will be linking a couple of the many projects I have programmed and cooked up
                    below.<br><br> Programming is something I actually really enjoy, though I am still also a beginner in it but I do
                    think that I am progressing pretty well in it. I am mostly familiar with javascript and some python though
                    I never really got interested in python. Well I think you see a common theme here. Lack of commitment. Thats
                    why I created this blog. To keep track of my work over time and sort of motivate myself to work on stuff.
                    I will be posting updates on pretty much all of these hobbies and passions that I get into and I hope you
                    find as much as interest as mine those hobbies.
